# FlyExample
> A project from [DailyDrip](https://www.dailydrip.com).

This is an example application showing off usage of my
[fly](http://github.com/dailydrip/fly) on-the-fly file processing framework for
Elixir.  If you load it up and visit the root, you'll see an image that's
resized on the fly.
